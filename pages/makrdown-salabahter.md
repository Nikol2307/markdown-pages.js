## Create sophisticated formatting for your prose and code on GitHub with simple syntax.

### Headings
To create a heading, add one to six # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the hierarchy level and typeface size of the heading.

```
# A first-level heading
## A second-level heading
### A third-level heading
```

When you use two or more headings, GitHub automatically generates a table of contents that you can access by clicking  within the file header. Each heading title is listed in the table of contents and you can click a title to navigate to the selected section.
